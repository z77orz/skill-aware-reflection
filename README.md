> *In the animal-welfare sciences, **environmental enrichment** is the practice of providing captive animals with diverse, biologically meaningful stimuli — to satisfy their physiological and psychological needs, promote natural behavior, and reduce stereotypy.*
>
> *This project borrows that idea — literally.*

| Domain | Captive setting (animal welfare) | Claude Code (this project) |
|---|---|---|
| Subject of enrichment | Captive animal | Procedural skill |
| Enriching stimulus | Diverse environment | Real task trajectories |
| Target behavior | Natural behavior display | Cross-scenario procedural competence |
| Behavior to avoid | Stereotypy (repetitive, purposeless) | Reapplying an outdated `b_i` to every new case |
| Enricher | Zookeeper | Agent (under the reflection framework) |

The metaphor is not decoration — it is the project's organizing principle:

> <b>No trajectory, no enrichment.</b> A skill that never sees a real run is a skill that never matures.

### What is in a name?

| **EmbodiSkill** | Framework name (paper) |
| **Skill-Aware Reflection** | Sub-method name inside the paper's framework |
| **丰容 / Skill Enrichment** | This engineering project — names the *stimulus → maturation* process as a whole |

After a **procedural task** finishes — one that applied a named skill, method, or multi-step procedure whose outcome depends on intermediate steps — this skill forces the agent to classify what happened into one of **four types** and produce a targeted, non-destructive revision of the underlying skill.

> *The defining test*: did the agent follow a procedure with ≥2 ordered steps where the result depended on intermediate state? If no — this skill does not apply.

> *Common question: how does this differ from hermes-agent?*
> *Short answer: **they are not competitors** — they target different users and different needs.*

### 5.1 Jobs to be Done

| 丰容 / Skill Enrichment | hermes-agent |
|---|---|
| When one of my Claude Code skills underperforms in some scenarios, I want to **precisely identify and surgically fix** the specific bad paragraph — not rewrite the whole skill — so I keep what's already correct and avoid the side effects of wholesale rewrites. | When I want a **24×7, cross-platform, remembering, learning-from-experience** personal AI assistant, I don't want to assemble memory systems, schedulers, message gateways, and skill frameworks myself — I want an out-of-the-box system that grows with me over the long term. |

### 5.2 Need hierarchy

| Need layer | 丰容 | hermes-agent |
|---|---|---|
| Functional | Paragraph-level targeted revision + 4-type classification | Multi-platform + multi-backend + automatic skill creation |
| Reliability | Prevents "bad edits" (guards against 3 documented systematic problems) | Prevents "data loss" (auto-archive + FTS5 search) |
| Usability | Available as soon as Claude Code's description trigger fires | Available from terminal + Telegram + Discord + … |
| Growth | A single skill paragraph gets more accurate over time | The whole agent becomes more attuned to the user |
| Pain eliminated | "My skill won't change / gets worse when I edit it" | "My agent doesn't remember / I can't find past work" |
| Investment style | One-shot precision work | Cumulative long-term investment |

### 5.3 Need-solution matrix

| User need | 丰容 | hermes-agent | Solved better by |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Which paragraph of my skill is broken?" | ✅ explicit + paragraph-level | ⚠️ LLM judgment | 丰容 |
| "I want an AI I can talk to from anywhere" | ❌ Claude Code only | ✅ CLI + Telegram + Discord + … | hermes-agent |
| "I want my agent to remember me across sessions" | ❌ no auto-mechanism | ✅ FTS5 + LLM summaries | hermes-agent |
| "I want a skill to appear without me writing it" | ❌ does not create | ✅ Curator distills | hermes-agent |
| "I want strict guarantees that skills won't be corrupted" | ✅ 4-type forced + `S_app` isolation | ⚠️ no explicit classification | 丰容 |
| "I want stale skills auto-archived" | ❌ manual | ✅ `stale_after_days` | hermes-agent |
| "I'm already in Claude Code and won't install new things" | ✅ one-skill install | ❌ full agent system install | 丰容 |
| "I want my agent to grow more attuned to me over time" | ❌ single-turn precision | ✅ closed-loop learning + persistence | hermes-agent |

### 5.4 Decision tree

```text
Are you mainly a Claude Code user?
├── Yes → Is your pain point skill maintenance?
│       ├── Yes → 丰容 ✅
│       └── No (you want multi-platform / long-term memory)
│           → you actually need hermes-agent
│
└── No → Do you want your own AI agent?
        ├── Yes (willing to install a full system) → hermes-agent ✅
        └── No (you just want occasional use) → neither
```

> **One-liner**: 丰容 is a **surgeon** — it precisely fixes what already exists. hermes-agent is a **long-term assistant** — it grows with you from experience. The two are **complementary, not competing**.

unzip Skill-Enrichment.skill -d ~/.claude/skills/

# Option 2 — Clone the repo (after rename)
git clone https://github.com/z77orz/Skill-Enrichment.git \
    ~/.claude/skills/Skill-Enrichment
```

The skill is auto-discovered by Claude Code once placed under `~/.claude/skills/Skill-Enrichment/`.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z77orz/Skill-Enrichment/master/assets/h2-en-validation.svg" alt="Validation" height="40"/>

The skill was validated against 4 benchmark evals.

| Configuration | Pass rate | Time | Tokens |
|---|---|---|---|
| **With Skill** | **100 %** | 62.3 s ± 12.3 s | 73,525 |
| Without Skill | 64 % | 50.9 s ± 5.8 s | 69,211 |
| **Delta** | **+0.36** | +11.5 s | +4,314 |

**Largest discriminator**: `SkillDefect` classification — baseline scored **25 %** (1/4) where with-skill scored **100 %** (4/4). Without the framework, agents tend to misclassify skill-content defects as execution lapses or produce vague patches.

To reproduce: see `~/.claude/skills/skill-aware-reflection-workspace/` (a sibling dev workspace that preserves the original project name for benchmark-result continuity) for the `grade.py` and `aggregate_benchmark.py` scripts.
