# Skill-Aware Reflection

> 中文版：[README.zh.md](./README.zh.md)

A Claude Code skill that operationalizes the four-type skill-aware reflection framework from [EmbodiSkill (Ju et al., 2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.10332v1).

After a **procedural task** finishes — one that applied a named skill, method, or multi-step procedure whose outcome depends on intermediate steps — this skill forces the agent to classify what happened into one of four types and produce a targeted, non-destructive revision of the underlying skill. Never a coarse whole-skill rewrite.

## The Four Reflection Types

| Type | Trigger | Action | Modifies |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Discovery** | Success + new capability the skill doesn't cover | Record new skill seed | `S_body` (append) |
| **Optimization** | Success + an existing paragraph has a better form | Replace or complete the targeted paragraph | `S_body` (replace / complete) |
| **SkillDefect** | Failure + the paragraph is wrong, incomplete, or underspecified | Replace or complete the targeted paragraph | `S_body` (replace / complete) |
| **ExecutionLapse** | Failure + paragraph is valid but the agent did not follow it | Append a reminder to the execution appendix | `S_app` only — never `S_body` |

The most error-prone boundary is **SkillDefect vs ExecutionLapse**. The skill provides a literal-comparison method to disambiguate them, and a one-question test: *"If the agent had followed the paragraph to the letter, would the task have succeeded?"* — Yes → ExecutionLapse, No → SkillDefect.

## Why

Existing skill self-evolution methods are *skill-unaware*: they convert trajectories into general feedback and rewrite the whole skill. EmbodiSkill shows this accumulates redundant content, overwrites valid guidance, and preserves incorrect prescriptions. The four-type classification fixes that.

## When to Use

Use when **all** of the following hold:

- A **procedural task** has just finished — one that required applying a named skill, method, or multi-step procedure whose outcome depends on intermediate steps. The defining test: did the agent follow a procedure with ≥2 ordered steps where the result depended on intermediate state?
- The task used at least one skill, sub-skill, or named procedure.
- The task outcome is evaluable: success, partial success, or failure.

Do NOT use for single tool calls, single information lookups, or single-step recall with no procedural skill involved.

## Installation

```bash
# Option 1: Unzip the packaged .skill file
unzip skill-aware-reflection.skill -d ~/.claude/skills/

# Option 2: Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/z77orz/skill-aware-reflection.git \
    ~/.claude/skills/skill-aware-reflection
```

The skill is auto-discovered by Claude Code once placed under `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Repository Structure

```

## Validation

The skill was validated against 4 benchmark evals. Results:

| Configuration | Pass Rate | Time | Tokens |
|---|---|---|---|
| **With Skill** | **100%** | 62.3s ± 12.3s | 73,525 |
| Without Skill | 64% | 50.9s ± 5.8s | 69,211 |
| **Delta** | **+0.36** | +11.5s | +4,314 |

Largest discriminator: `SkillDefect` classification — baseline scored 25% (1/4) where with-skill scored 100% (4/4). Without the framework, agents tend to misclassify skill-content defects as execution lapses or produce vague patches.

To reproduce: see `~/.claude/skills/skill-aware-reflection-workspace/` (in the local development environment) for the `grade.py` and `aggregate_benchmark.py` scripts.
